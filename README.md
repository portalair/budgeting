# Small Budgeting App

![](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/NimbleOptimisticHyracotherium-size_restricted.gif)

just a small webapp i made trying to learn a bit of react and d3 :)

probably a bit rough around the edges since I'm very new to react. Done mainly angular the past 4-5 years.

`npm start`
if you want to host locally and mess around with it.
